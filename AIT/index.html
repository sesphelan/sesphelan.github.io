        <h3><b>Description: </b></h3>
        <p>From the bottom up, I created an Express application consisting of multiple user-interaction features, such as<br>
        a playable JavaScript version of Snake, a section for Reviews/Comments for myself to read, and a High Scores Leaderboard.<br>
        In order to record your score, please make an account and choose a difficulty to begin playing the game.<br><br>
        The data recorded by users is managed by MongoDB. The site was built with Node JS.
